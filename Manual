Hybrid assembly and PacBio assembly were merged using a custom C++ program
(https://github.com/mahulchak/quickmerge). The program takes two fasta files
(containing contigs from a PB only assembly and contigs from a hybrid assembly) as
inputs and splices contigs from the two assemblies together to produce an assembly
with higher contiguity. First, the program MUMmer(Kurtz, et al. 2004) is used to
compute the unique alignments between contigs from the two assemblies
